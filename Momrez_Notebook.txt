My dataset was “Allegheny County Property Tax Delinquency Data”(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-property-tax-delinquency/resource/ed0d1550-c300-4114-865c-82dc7c23235b).
This analysis generated the stability metric using the goal of quantifying long-term reliability of a neighborhood, as well as the minimum risk of investing in that neighborhood’s properties.

Sub-metrics:
Three submetrics (derived from the delinquency records) were used to evaluate a property's financial stability.
They are as follows: 
1. Delinquency Frequency (ratio of delinquent taxes per property) 
2. Financial Severity (total dollar amount of tax delinquency per property) 
3. Residential Focus (percentage of residential properties compared to commercial).


Algorithm:

Filtering and Cleaning: Filtered the dataset for all properties with missing neighborhood fields and limited the analysis to properties located in Pittsburgh.

Calculating Sub-metrics: Used counts and sums grouped by neighborhood to calculate the three sub-metrics: S1, S2, and S3 for each neighborhood.

Normalization and Weighting: For each neighborhood, I calculated a final score after normalizing each of the three sub-metrics on a scale of 0 to 1 and finding the final weighted average (weightings are as follows: S1 = 40%, S2 = 30%, S3 = 30%).

Plotting Results: The final ten neighborhoods with the highest and lowest Property Risk and Stability Index scores will be displayed in the charts.

Reflections on my analysis demonstrate that, based on the three components of the Property Risk and Stability Index, the neighborhood that is rated as the most financially stable to live in is Glen Hazel.
