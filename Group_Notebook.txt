Momrez Conclusion: Based on my analysis and the synthesis of all three submetrics, I conclude that Ridgemont presents the strongest data-driven case for the best neighborhood, as it matches the other analyses. My own metric regarding Property Risk & Stability Index supports this, which ranks Ridgemont as one of the top  ranking neighbourhoods. A high Property Risk & Stability Index indicates long-term stability and represents a low financial risk from the low amount of overdue property taxes (property tax delinquency) and the large proportion of residential houses located in proximity.

Amitva Conclusion: After diving into the Pittsburgh Police Arrest dataset and taking a look at those three safety metrics—total arrest volume, violent-crime share, and long-term arrest trends—it’s clear that Ridgemont stands out as the safest and most stable neighborhood. This area consistently shows up among those with the lowest number of arrests, which suggests there's not much crime happening. Plus, it has one of the lowest rates of violent arrests, pointing to fewer serious offenses. The analysis over time shows no increases in monthly arrests, further supporting Ridgemont's image as a low-risk place over the years. These observations match with the broader trends in neighborhood stability; my own Property Risk & Stability Index also ranks Ridgemont highly, thanks to its low property-tax delinquency and a good number of stable homes. All in all, the arrest data and other stability signs come together to really highlight Ridgemont as the top choice for the safest, most stable neighborhood.

Sharvi Conclusion: Based on my analysis, Ridgemont is the best neighborhood as it is common to all three of our datasets and shows the best overall stability and safety based on all the submetrics and overall scores.
