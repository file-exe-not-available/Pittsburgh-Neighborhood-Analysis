I chose the Pitt 2009-13 and then 2019-23 dataset. 

Since it is a big dataset with a lot of information, I will be focusing on a few submetrics.
Submetrics:
Median Household Income
Poverty Rate
Owner-Occupancy Rate
Population Change
% Bachelor's Degree or Higher
Median Rent or Rent Burden
% Households with Children

Most of these metrics correspond to a specific column in my dataset, so I will be filtering my
dataset according to that. I will also be filtering out the first few rows, as they are by region and
not neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.

1. Filter out the first 6 entries as they correspond to regions outside of Pittsburgh
2. Put each submetric in one cell and compute the difference from 2013 to 2023.
3. Give an improvement score to each neighborhood after normalizing by average
4. Plot the top 10 and bottom 10 neighborhoods.

Reflection: According to my analysis based on all the metrics South Shore is the best neighborhood to live in.
